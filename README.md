# decoderRing
The sister program to Encoder Ring. Used to decode basic messages created with Encoder Ring.

8/8/18 - The plan for this program is to have it load a custom library from Encoder Ring and
decode a message using the library. I feel like making the encoder will be rather easy but saving
the library as some type of custom file type to be read by Decoder Ring sounds difficult.

Decoder Ring would need to store a library and use that to decode another seperate encoded file.

Now I realize that Encoder Ring will likely have a similar problem in storing a library in order
to generate a message. Sounds challenging and fun!

To my CSULA friends Aloha!
